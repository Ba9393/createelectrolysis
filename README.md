3. Create: Liquid Fuels (any)
4. Any addon that adds SU -> Fe conversion (Create: Crafts and Additions is advised)

## Step 1: Making the electrolyser:
First things first, you actually need to make the block. How? Just Enough Items doesnt show nay recipe! (my bad for that i was lazy) You just simply right click a create basin with the new Rods! The recipe for rods is available in JEI, but if you must know, it can be crafted with andesite alloy in the whole top row, then 4 iron nugguts in the configuration of boots.

## Step 2: Using the electrolyser:
Now, supplying the electrolyser with Forge Energy and water, it will start converting, aka 'electrolysing'. This will happen at a rate of 30 mB of water + 10 Fe of energy => 20 mB of hydrogen and 10 mB of oxygen. Both of these resulting liquids can be fed into blaze burners to make them superheated, replacing the need for annoyingly clunky blaze cake factories.

## Step 3: Extracting the hydrogen and oxygen from the electrolyser:
Finally, you basically need smart pipes to make sure you get the right gas. You'll notice, when getting the bucket, that you and pipes cannot place the gas down. Why? Its because i wasnt bothered to code a full on redesign of fluids. If you place it down with commands, you will find that it's texture is kinda ccursed. Truth is, i just couldnt firgure out why it wouldnt be trasnparent.

## Step 4: Using the gas:
Connect pipes to blaze burners and done! you now have superheated blaze burners. without going through the insanity of a blaze cake farm.
